- To run a project, first you need to install Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/. After installed nodejs, run ```npm --version``` to check Node.js is successfully installed. 
- Go to the project directory and run ```npm install```
- Then run ```npm start``` to host a server. After that, server is hosted at ```http://localhost:8080``` or ```127.0.0.1:8080```. Make sure you do not use that port for other projects.
